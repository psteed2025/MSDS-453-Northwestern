‘Thunderbolts’ Review: The Best Marvel Movie In A Long Time, With One Big Problem
By Erik Kain,

Thunderbolts has rekindled some of the magic lost in the MCU, though it’s not without its problems. Then again, no Marvel film is without its flaws. At least this one seems to understand what audiences want better than most post-End Game efforts from the studio.
Thunderbolts feels a bit more like old-school MCU fare. It’s leaps and bounds better than the other most recent Marvel movie, the cumbersome and unsatisfying Captain America: Brave New World.
The movie works on a lot of levels. It’s quite funny, for one thing, with a great blend of humor thanks to Harbour’s over-the-top Red Guardian and Yelena’s acerbic wit. The chemistry between Pugh, Harbour, Russell and Pullman is genuinely great. And Sebastian Stan gets to have one very cool action sequence to remind us how much of a badass the Winter Soldier really is, and how much he really deserves his own movie. The action is great throughout the film, and the whole thing is really well-paced, clocking in at just about two hours.
As it stands, this felt like too many other MCU films with strong opening arcs and a rushed conclusion. I often complain that superhero movies are too long, but this one might have benefited from a bit more screen time, or more economical use of time earlier on in the picture.
Still, I enjoyed this a great deal even if I wouldn’t include it with S-Tier MCU films like The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Spider-Man: No Way Home. Thunderbolts has a lot of heart, a great sense of humor and enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat. While it stumbles in the third act, it’s still worth a watch. And be sure to stick around for both the mid-credits and post-credits scene. The latter is actually pretty meaty, and sets up Phase 6 of the MCU.
P.S. I’ve seen some people saying the film engages too much in “girlboss” stuff or makes the male characters seem stupid compared to the female characters. While this has definitely been an issue in some MCU products (ahem, She-Hulk) I really don’t think it’s a very good critique of Thunderbolts. Characters like John Walker and Red Guardian are definitely played for laughs, but they also get some really great moments with heart and badassery. It felt like a pretty solid balance across the cast, with everyone flawed but ultimately likeable and heroic.
And I’m so glad that we aren’t doing multiverse stuff anymore! Only Loki and No Way Home handled this really well. Even Deadpool & Wolverine was bogged down by the multiverse garbage. But that’s just my personal opinion, shaped by overuse of the gimmick over the years. (The Spider-Verse films do it well also, but aren’t part of the MCU).
