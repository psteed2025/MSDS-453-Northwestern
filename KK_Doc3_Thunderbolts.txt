It can’t quite shake loose of the consistent problems in the MCU’s recent output (turn a light on!). Still, it challenges blockbuster fans in unexpected ways, presenting them with richer acting than we’ve seen in these films in some time and, perhaps most shockingly, a final act that’s emotionally grounded instead of just “CGI things go boom.” It ends on a note that feels like a preview for another movie (or movies), a common problem in the MCU, but this time it’s almost as interesting a final touch narratively as it is driven by marketing. Could the MCU get its groove back with a group of outcasts who defy what it means to be a hero? Maybe it was always the only way they could..]

“Thunderbolts*” is an odd duck of a superhero flick, one that almost leans into the skid of the MCU, and, by doing so, might actually straighten it out. It can’t quite shake loose of the consistent problems in the MCU’s recent output (turn a light on!). Still, it challenges blockbuster fans in unexpected ways, presenting them with richer acting than we’ve seen in these films in some time and, perhaps most shockingly, a final act that’s emotionally grounded instead of just “CGI things go boom.” It ends on a note that feels like a preview for another movie (or movies), a common problem in the MCU, but this time it’s almost as interesting a final touch narratively as it is driven by marketing.

“Thunderbolts*” leans into the self-serious tone of much of Marvel lately by embedding it in the film’s subject matter and visual language. Even the opening Marvel logo is drained of color, something that’s largely followed by the palette of the film that follows. Red Guardian’s outfit looks closer to brown in a film that’s been so desaturated that when a guy in a yellow chicken outfit shows up late, it’s almost a jump-scare. At times, the drab filmmaking feels thematically resonant. But there are more visually creative ways to do it than the ones employed by the incredible cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo (“The Green Knight”), who falls victim to the paint-by-numbers approach to these films (and the only paint colors he has are brown and browner). It doesn’t help that Schreier’s action choreography doesn’t shine, leaving us with too little to hold onto as this film takes off.
Yet it somehow finds a way to reach its destination. By the time the crew is together, following a standout car chase sequence in which Bucky joins the gang, the pieces start falling into place. Of course, it helps a great deal to have multiple Oscar nominees in the cast. The best MCU films are often elevated by actual performances from actors who don’t just meet fan expectations of comic book characters brought to three-dimensional life but exceed them (think Robert Downey Jr. and Chadwick Boseman), and that’s what Pugh does here, using Yelena’s depression as a throughline to find her character’s rhythm instead of just as a crutch. Ghost is so woefully underwritten that John-Kamen can’t make much of an impact and Stan looks like he’s grown weary of playing this character, but the ensemble largely works.
And the truth is, sometimes that’s enough. Some of the best movies in the history of the MCU have thrived off bouncing interesting characters and performances off each other in projects like “The Avengers” and “Guardians of the Galaxy.” I don’t expect “Thunderbolts*” to have the same culture-shaping legacy as those projects. “Thunderbolts*” reminded this former comic book reader and fan of much of the early films in the MCU and what these blockbusters could do before they got too reliant on multiverses: Remind you of the humanity in the heroism. Maybe these second-rate Avengers really are the heroes that 2025 needs.
